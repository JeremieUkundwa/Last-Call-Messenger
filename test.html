          Every country on every continent has at some time witnessed war and
          its accompanying carnage. Our parents or grandparents lived through
          the horrors of World War II. Their parents witnessed World War I. Add
          Korea and Vietnam and the Gulf War, and the many wars not as visible
          to the Western world, and we realize conflict is a fact of life. A
          regrettable, bitter fact of life, but a fact of life nonetheless. This
          generation should not expect to avoid senseless sorrow on a massive
          scale. What generation has?</span

          >Although we understandably feel we should. This is 2022! Invasions,
          needless killing, and unprovoked aggression? Exactly. None of it makes
          sense, at least from where we view the world. But why should we be
          shocked when a larger nation invades its smaller neighbor? This is
          what nations do. It’s what they have always done.

          entirely appropriate at a time like this. But they won’t stop future
          invasions from happening, nor will they dissuade despots and dictators
          from doing what despots and dictators do. The war in Ukraine will one
          day be over, and before long another will begin. And when it does,
          we’ll ask ourselves the same questions again: “Haven’t we learned from
          the lessons of the past? How can one country do this to another? What
          about all the innocent people and the tragic loss of
          life?”&nbsp;</span

          slides downhill, hostility between nations has shaped the geopolitical

          destroy man whom I have created from the face of the earth,” (Genesis

          suicide. It seemed to him life had become so completely hopeless he
          had no better option than to end it all. While he was walking back to
          his vehicle after paying for his gas, he heard a voice calling his
          name. A man he vaguely knew approached him. “What are you doing
          Tuesday?” the man asked him. “Would you be interested in attending a
          Bible study in my home?” My friend paused, considered the invitation,
          and accepted. He drove home, resumed his life, and looked forward to
          Tuesday night. Months later he was baptized. Today he is a lay leader
          in his local church, having been used by God for many years in
          Christian ministry, and very much alive. The reason? Someone
          intervened, someone reached out, someone followed the prompting of the
          Holy Spirit to invest in the life of another.</span
